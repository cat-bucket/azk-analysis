# Pencil Drawing Duplicate Detection Model

## Overview

This project implements a lightweight AI model for duplicate detection in pencil drawings. The model analyzes stroke patterns, shading techniques, and compositional elements to identify similarities or potential plagiarism across hand-drawn artworks. It operates as a self-contained module within a larger analysis pipeline, requiring custom training for specific datasets.

## Core Features

### 1. Specialized Pattern Recognition
   - Analyzes micro-features unique to pencil drawings (e.g., hatching density, pressure variations, erasure traces) using convolutional filters.
   - Generates similarity scores based on stroke-level comparisons, ignoring semantic content to focus on execution techniques.
### 2.  Training-Dependent Architecture
   - No pre-trained weights are included; users must train the model using proprietary pencil drawing datasets.
   - Supports transfer learning via customizable input layers for small datasets (â‰¥500 samples recommended).
### 3. Fuzzy Output Interface
   - Returns similarity metrics as abstract confidence intervals (e.g., 
"Match Probability: 0.72â€“0.88") without exposing decision thresholds or feature maps.
   - All internal operations (data preprocessing, vectorization) remain encapsulated.

## Technical Constraints

- Input: Grayscale sketches (600dpi min) with noise-reduction preprocessing.
- Output: JSON-formatted similarity reports containing anonymized artwork IDs and probability ranges.
- Dependency: Requires GPU acceleration for training; inference runs on CPU.

## notice
ðŸ”’ Model parameters and training scripts are intentionally omitted. Users must implement their own training routines.

The implementation assumes familiarity with pencil drawing digitization standards and adversarial training techniques. For deployment, replace placeholder endpoints with internal APIs after model training.
